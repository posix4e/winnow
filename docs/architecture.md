# Wallet architecture

Winnow's app owns the user interaction and device integration. WalletCore
provides its Bitcoin rules, on top of the pinned
[swift-secp256k1](https://github.com/21-DOT-DEV/swift-secp256k1) package
(Bitcoin Core's libsecp256k1). Shared control is limited to raw k-of-n
script-path multisig accounts in Advanced mode, optionally with a Ledger as one
signer over Bluetooth; there is no MuSig2. The app and
development tools use the root [Package.swift](../Package.swift) and its
lockfile.

## Source ownership

| Component | Owns | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [WinnowApp](../Sources/WinnowApp/README.md) | SwiftUI screens, payment review, authentication, lifecycle, persistence, background scheduling and iCloud backup | WalletCore and Apple frameworks |
| WalletCore | Keys, descriptors, scripts, PSBTs, transactions, silent payments, wallet state, people and contact cards, and Bitcoin P2P networking | swift-secp256k1 (P256K) |
| [TestSupport](../Tests/Support/README.md) | In-memory keys, controlled peers and disposable Bitcoin Core fixtures | WalletCore; development only |
| [winnow-debug](../Tools/Debug/README.md) | Offline inspection, diagnostics, generators and network soaks | WalletCore |
| [WinnowFuzz](../Tools/Fuzz/README.md) | Bounded hostile-input parsing and invariants | WalletCore through WinnowFuzzCore |
| [winnow-fixture](../Tools/Fixture/README.md) | Test-bank preparation | TestSupport |

There is no VaultKit and no shared-account record. An import bundle that
carries shared-account records from the shared-account Winnow is refused
rather than restored without those funds.

WalletCore is a SwiftPM library product. It shares the app's source revision
and version tags; there is no separate library release train. The package has
no third-party dependencies: the native module is checked against answers
recorded from libsecp256k1, and the signet miner has the node's own wallet sign
block challenges. `scripts/check-dependencies` keeps Xcode from resolving any
other package.

## Receiving and synchronization

[AppModel](../Sources/WinnowApp/AppModel.swift) coordinates wallet state and the
network actors. Peers supply headers, compact block filters and requested
blocks. The wallet matches filters locally, fetches candidate blocks and
updates its tracked coins and transaction history. Short mempool subscriptions
provide unconfirmed-payment detection while the relevant screens are open.

This is a compact-filter wallet. Its checks do not establish the same view as
independently validating every block from genesis. Peer choice, checkpoints,
filter agreement and catch-up limits are described in the bundled
[read-side guide](read-side.html). Direct peers observe connection metadata and
requests. Optional SOCKS gateways change transport; they do not remove the
wallet's chain-verification assumptions.

## Payment review and signing

The app presents the recipient, amount and fee, authenticates protected
actions, and invalidates stale reviews when payment inputs change. WalletCore
constructs transactions and validates PSBT commitments.

Receiving uses BIP86 Taproot, and every spend is a key-path spend signed by
this phone's key; the pinned secp256k1 package derives keys, applies the Taproot
tweak and makes the BIP340 signature. A send may also pay a BIP352 silent
payment code, whose output is derived from the spent inputs' keys
([SilentPayments](../Sources/WalletCore/SilentPayments/README.md)). Contact-card labels do not
establish authority; the descriptor and verified signatures do. The
[write-side](write-side.html) guide explains the protocol and its limits.

## Persistence, keys and backup

The app persists wallet and presentation state and supplies the Keychain-backed
implementation of WalletCore's key-store interface. Local signing secrets use
device-only, user-presence-protected Keychain entries. In-memory key storage
belongs to TestSupport.

The app also owns [CloudWalletBackup](../Sources/WinnowApp/CloudWalletBackup.swift),
[CloudBackupController](../Sources/WinnowApp/CloudBackupController.swift) and
[ICloudBackupStore](../Sources/WinnowApp/ICloudBackupStore.swift). They encode and
encrypt backup contents, schedule retries and perform private CloudKit writes.
The backup wrapping key uses a separate, synchronizable iCloud Keychain service.
That cloud copy adds Apple Account and iCloud Keychain dependencies to secret
protection; it does not change the local signing key's access controls.

A successful save date confirms the upload of encrypted contents. Manual files
and recovery words remain part of the [backup guidance](import.html).
[CloudKit setup](../CloudKit/README.md) covers schema, encryption and validation.

## Source map

WalletCore directories organize one module:

- Primitives: [crypto and encodings](../Sources/WalletCore/Crypto/README.md),
  [keys](../Sources/WalletCore/Keys/README.md),
  [descriptors](../Sources/WalletCore/Descriptors/README.md) and
  [scripts](../Sources/WalletCore/Script/README.md).
- Spending: [wallet state](../Sources/WalletCore/Wallet/README.md),
  [PSBTs](../Sources/WalletCore/PSBT/README.md) and
  [transactions](../Sources/WalletCore/Transactions/README.md).
- Synchronization: [headers](../Sources/WalletCore/Network/Headers/README.md),
  [filters](../Sources/WalletCore/Network/Filters/README.md) and
  [peer selection](../Sources/WalletCore/Network/Peers/README.md).
- Communication: [transport](../Sources/WalletCore/Network/Transport/README.md),
  [wire protocol](../Sources/WalletCore/Network/Protocol/README.md),
  [broadcast](../Sources/WalletCore/Network/Broadcast/README.md) and
  [mempool](../Sources/WalletCore/Network/Mempool/README.md).
- Silent payments: [sending](../Sources/WalletCore/SilentPayments/README.md).

The [testing guide](testing.md) maps the test targets to these responsibilities.
[Scripts](../scripts/README.md) and [workflows](../.github/workflows/README.md)
index the build and release entry points. Security reports and dated audit
evidence live under [security](security/README.md); their findings and results
apply to the revisions they identify.

The public website has its own
[repository](https://github.com/winnowwallet/website). The app bundles four
HTML guides and their stylesheet from this repository's `docs/` directory.
Changes to those bundled files are app changes and participate in CI's build
fingerprint.
