/-! # Shared I/O plumbing for the I/O area

The Swift networking code is a set of actors whose methods `throw` many unrelated error types, and
whose callers dispatch on the type (`catch let e as PeerError where e.isTransport`). Here every I/O
operation runs in `NetM := EIO NetError`, one error type with a case per Swift error type, so the same
dispatch is a `match`. Lean `IO` errors (sockets, files, processes) are lifted into `NetError.other`.

Also here: the clocks (wall clock in seconds, monotonic milliseconds), one-shot timers on libuv
(`after`, no thread is held while waiting), atomic file writes (temp file + rename: Foundation's
`.atomic`; the iOS file-protection class has no Lean equivalent), size-bounded reads, and
`EventStream`, the stand-in for `AsyncStream`/`AsyncThrowingStream` with `bufferingNewest`. -/
