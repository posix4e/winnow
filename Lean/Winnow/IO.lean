/-! # The I/O area (port of WalletCore's networking that talks to real peers)

| Lean | Swift (Sources/WalletCore/Network/…) |
|---|---|
| `IO/Base.lean` | the error enums' cases and `errorDescription`s; `Duration` timers, `.atomic` writes, `AsyncStream` |
| `IO/Transport.lean` | `Transport/PeerConnection.swift` (on `Std.Async.TCP`, libuv) |
| `IO/Http.lean` | `Transport/RoutedHTTPClient.swift`: policy in Lean, the fetch injected (`HttpFetch`; `curlFetch` for tests) |
| `IO/Diversity.lean` | `Peers/PeerDiversity.swift`, `SeedAddressFilter` (BSD `inet_pton` ported), `PersistedPeers` (peers.json) |
| `IO/Seeds.lean` | `Peers/SeedResolver.swift` (DoH through `RoutedHTTPClient`, `getaddrinfo` via `Std.Async.DNS`) |
| `IO/Census.lean` | `Peers/CensusCatalog.swift` (the list shipped with the build: `CensusCatalog.bundled`) |
| `IO/Headers.lean` | `Headers/HeaderChain.swift`: file read/write and `sync(using:)` (the chain is Net's pure `HeaderChain`) |
| `IO/Pool.lean` | `Peers/PeerPool.swift` |
| `IO/Filters.lean` | `Filters/FilterSync.swift`: `sync`, `transaction(_:at:)`, filters.json (decisions: Net's `FilterSync`) |
| `IO/Mempool.lean` | `Mempool/MempoolWindow.swift`: timers, listeners, getdata (bookkeeping: Net's `MempoolWindow`) |
| `IO/Broadcast.lean` | `Broadcast/TxBroadcaster.swift`, broadcast.json |

Actors are structures over `IO.Ref` state changed by atomic `modifyGet`s (the chain is under a
`Std.Mutex`); async sequences are `EventStream`s; long-lived loops (one receive loop per connection,
the pool monitor, stream listeners) are dedicated threads; timeouts and backoff are libuv timers.
Errors are one `NetError` with a case per Swift error type (`NetM := EIO NetError`).

Tests: `Lean/IOTest.lean` (`lake build io-test && .lake/build/bin/io-test [--swift <oracle-io>]`), against
a disposable regtest bitcoind and scripted fake peers; `LeanOracle/IO/main.swift` runs the Swift
side on the same node (built outside SwiftPM:
`swiftc -O -I .build/release -Xcc -fmodule-map-file=.build/out/Intermediates.noindex/GeneratedModuleMaps/libsecp256k1.modulemap
LeanOracle/IO/main.swift .build/release/{WalletCore,P256K,libsecp256k1}.o -o oracle-io`
after `swift build -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing --product oracle-net`).

## Not covered (by the port or by the tests)

* No TLS in Lean: every HTTPS fetch (census list, DoH, explorer) is the injected `HttpFetch`; the live
  census/DoH endpoints are not exercised (no network in the tests). In-flight HTTP cancellation is not
  ported (a cancelled client only refuses new requests).
* No `fsync` and no `seek` in Lean's file API: header appends flush instead of `synchronize()`, and a
  file longer than its count is rewritten whole. No iOS data-protection class on written files.
* No task cancellation: Swift's `CancellationError` paths (connect torn down on cancel, sync loops
  stopping) have no trigger here; `NetError.cancelled` exists for callers that want to throw it.
* A refused TCP dial fails at once (`disconnected`) where NWConnection waits in `.waiting` until the
  dial timeout (`timeout`); hostnames are dialled at their first resolved address.
* Not tested against a node: census-driven candidate selection, DNS-seed dialling, stale-tip eviction,
  `catchUp`, the cfcheckpt/cfheaders votes with disagreeing peers (only the single-peer degraded mode
  and agreeing votes run), deprioritization and fee-floor events, the backlog's byte ceiling, and the
  keepalive's idle timeout. iOS reconnect-on-foreground is the app's job (PORT.md). -/
